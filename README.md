### 👋 Hi, I’m @csarfigueroa

- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, cloud architecture, serverless technologies, and using tech to solve real-world problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced computer science concepts through the Online Master's in Computer Science program at UT Austin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend-heavy projects, cloud migration initiatives, or infrastructure design with a focus on scalability and cost optimization.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csarfigueroa), or drop me a message here on GitHub.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I transitioned from a local developer to working for a U.S.-based consulting firm, and I dream of one day building a platform to support tech talent in Central America.
