### 👋 Hey, I’m César Figueroa

I’m a backend developer with a strong focus on clean architecture, cloud-native solutions, and making things work reliably at scale. I currently work at Allata, a U.S.-based consulting firm, where I wear multiple hats—as a Solution Architect, Tech Lead, and Senior Developer—depending on the project.

What I enjoy the most is diving into complex problems, breaking them down, and building something solid with a team. Whether it’s improving performance, designing infrastructure, or mentoring someone who's just getting started, that’s where I feel most at home.

Right now, I'm also studying Computer Science at UT Austin through their online master's program. It’s tough, but worth it—I like understanding what’s behind the abstractions.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me reading source code like it’s a novel, testing out AWS services I probably don’t need (yet), or chasing down a bug that disappears the moment I hit “print(‘debug’)”.
